# Running the code

In order to run the pipeline, you need to specify the path where the data is stored.

```bash
python main.py C:\Users\Dimitri\Documents\wemap\pipeline\pipelineData\wemap-office-one-room-v1\wemap-office-one-room-v1
```


### Known Problems:
- sometimes you can run out of memory so it's best to run this alone and close other applications



### To-do:
- if we already have the data processed, skip this step
- list like *[process,train,render]*
